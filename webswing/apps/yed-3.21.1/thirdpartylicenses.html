   "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
   exercising permissions granted by this License.

   "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
   including but not limited to software source code, documentation
   source, and configuration files.

   "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
   transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
   not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
   and conversions to other media types.

   "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
   Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
   copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
   (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

   "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
   form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
   editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
   represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
   of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
   separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
   the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

   (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
       stating that You changed the files; and

   (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
       that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
   any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
   by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
   this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
   Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
   the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
   with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  corresponding fee has been paid.
</p>
<p><b>2. RESTRICTIONS.</b> Software is confidential and
  copyrighted. Title to Software and all associated intellectual
  property rights is retained by Sun and/or its licensors. Except
  as specifically authorized in any Supplemental License Terms, you may
  not make copies of Software, other than a single copy of Software for
  archival purposes. Unless enforcement is prohibited by
  applicable law, you may not modify, decompile, or reverse engineer
  Software. You acknowledge that Software is not designed,
  licensed or intended for use in the design, construction, operation
  or maintenance of any nuclear facility. Sun disclaims any
  express or implied warranty of fitness for such uses. No right,
  title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade
  name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.
</p>
<p><b>3. LIMITED WARRANTY.</b> Sun warrants to you that for a
  period of ninety (90) days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by
  a copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if
  any) will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under
  normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS
  IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability
  under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace
  Software media or refund the fee paid for Software.
</p>
<p><b>4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</b> UNLESS SPECIFIED IN
  THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS
  AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY,
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED,
  EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY
  INVALID.
</p>
<p><b>5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</b> TO THE EXTENT NOT
  PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE
  FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
  CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED
  REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
  THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED
  OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's
  liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence),
  or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this
  Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the
  above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.
</p>
<p><b>6. Termination.</b> This Agreement is effective
  until terminated. You may terminate this Agreement at any time
  by destroying all copies of Software. This Agreement will
  terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you fail to comply
  with any provision of this Agreement. Upon Termination, you
  must destroy all copies of Software.
</p>

  regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to
  obtain such licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be
  required after delivery to you.
</p>
<p><b>8. U.S. Government Restricted Rights.</b> If
  Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or
  by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier),
  then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying
  documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in
  accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of
  Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for
  non-DOD acquisitions).
</p>
<p><b>9. Governing Law.</b> Any action related to this
  Agreement will be governed by California law and controlling U.S.
  federal law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will
  apply.
</p>
<p><b>10. Severability.</b> If any provision of this Agreement
  is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect
  with the provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the
  intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately
  terminate.
</p>
<p><b>11. Integration.</b> This Agreement is the entire
  agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter.
  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written
  communications, proposals, representations and warranties and
  prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote,
